# Crowd-Egress-Simulation_Cellular-Automaton
Crowd characteristics and movements are an essential field of research due to their many real-life applications and benefits. This paper provides a detailed simulation analysis of Crowd Egress using Python implementation and MontoCarlo principles. Utilizing cellular automaton modeling principles, the paper builds and analyzes multiple experiments to different realistic scenarios. The paper concludes by illustrating the best actions for room egress by explaining the relationship between simulation parameters and the time taken to clear the room completely
